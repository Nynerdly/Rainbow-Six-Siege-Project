                Elżbieta "Ela" Bosak was born in Wrocław, Poland. She is the youngest daughter of Jan Bosak, 
                former commander of the Polish Special Forces unit GROM. She is also the younger sister of 
                Zofia Bosak. Growing up, her father favored Zofia, causing a rift between them. Despite this, 
                Zofia was highly protective of her sister.

                Independent, creative, and rebellious, Elżbieta is intimate with the risks involved with her 
                particular role, having suffered many losses in Iraq. The sudden death of her father provided 
                her with a profound need for purpose. Elżbieta internalized the belief that she must prove 
                posthumously her worth to her father and make amends. She uses her memory of him to push 
                herself to unrealistic standards and to lead high-risk operations.
